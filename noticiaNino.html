    A few weeks ago, my kids wanted to hack my linux desktop, so they typed and clicked everywhere, while I was standing behind them looking at them play... when the screensaver core dumped and they actually hacked their way in! wow, those little hackers... <br>
    I thought it was a unique incident, but they managed to do it a second time. So I'd consider this issue... reproducible... by kids <br>
    I tried to recreate the crash on my own with no success, maybe because it required more than 4 little hands typing and using the mouse on the virtual keyboard.<br>
    Maybe not the best bug report, but I've seen the screenlock crash twice already with my own eyes, so its pretty real.<br>
    One last thing, after the desktop is unlocked, I can't re-lock it again, the screensaver process is pretty dead and requires me to open a shell and run 'cinnamon-screensaver' manually to get it working.<br>
